# AutoSaveKey-C#

A simple C# feature to automatically save the user's key after registration and pre-fill it when the program is opened again.

## Overview

This project helps improve user experience by storing the user's authentication key locally after registration. When the user reopens the program, the saved key is automatically loaded and displayed, so the user doesn't have to enter it again.

## Features

- Saves the user key locally (e.g., in a file or Windows registry).
- Automatically loads and pre-fills the key input field on program start.
- Simplifies the login/registration process for returning users.
- Easy to integrate with existing C# WinForms or WPF applications.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NoMoreLife-1/AutoSaveKey-CSharp.git
